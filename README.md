Priority Non-Preemptive scheduling is a CPU process scheduling method that selects processes based on priority. The process with the highest priority (lowest priority number) is chosen first. Once a process starts executing, it runs to completion without being interrupted, even if a higher-priority process arrives in the queue.

This method ensures that important tasks are handled first but may lead to starvation, where low-priority processes are indefinitely delayed if higher-priority processes keep arriving.
